                            are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
                            scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                            that program, any function or conditional state can access that

                            can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly
                            brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                            conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
                            to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

        <h3>4. How does JS eventloop work?</h3>
         <p><strong>javascript</strong> is an high level,
            interpreted, single threaded non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent
            language.<br/>
            A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
          instruction that can be managed independently by a scheduler. A
          programming language is single-threaded means it can only perform one
          task or operation at a single time. This means it would execute an
          entire process from start to end without the thread being interrupted
          or stopped. Unlike multi-threaded languages where multiple processes
          can be run on several threads concurrently without blocking each
          other.There is no one definition of blocking; it just simply means things
          that are running slowly on the thread. So non-blocking means things
          that aren’t slow on the thread.
